API & UI: single artifact proposal apply endpoint and extract-nodes/create-edges terminology

- Add POST /artifact/proposal/apply as the single endpoint for applying artifact proposals
  (generate and upload). Request body: ArtifactProposalApplyBody (decision_id, artifact_type,
  artifact_id | cache_key, optional proposal_data, cycle_id, artifact_types).
- Align naming on "extract nodes and create edges" (drop link/enrichment in docs and API surface).
- Persist decision as approved (KG+decision pair) when apply succeeds; backend is source of truth.
- Refactor tools to harmonize on common schema-driven approach across upload, generate, and refine.
- Add optional local LLM server configuration to .env for development.
- Change default log level from INFO to DEBUG in .env; update start.sh so LOG_LEVEL is respected in Docker.
- Improve markdown replacement guidelines in docs for Unicode handling.
- Add artifact types and prompts in artifact_markdown_schema.json for LLM integration.
- Update docs (artifact flows, decision persist, upload vs generate) to match new endpoint and terminology.
